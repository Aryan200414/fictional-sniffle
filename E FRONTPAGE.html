<p><font face="times new roman" size="+2">Flights to Barcelona</font></p>
<p><font face="times new roman" size="-1" >It’s hard to imagine a more traveller-friendly place than Barcelona, which seems to have something for everyone.

Flights to Barcelona take you to a city that boasts the best of both worlds. On the one hand, there’s the ultra-modern side to the city centre, with its Antoni Gaudí architecture, luxury hotels, high-end restaurants and designer boutiques. On the other, Barcelona has a thriving beach culture, with more than 4km of coastline. The city is a hugely popular surfing destination, and Barceloneta is regularly named as one of the best urban beaches in the world.

Staying on dry land is just as rewarding though, especially if you decide to explore the city on foot – you never know what you’ll stumble across. You might even want to opt for an official guided tour just to make sure you don’t miss anything. (Runner Bean Tours, for example, host child-friendly guided walks of the city.)</font></p>
<p><font face="times new roman" size="-1">However, if you’re feeling adventurous and would rather go it alone, Las Ramblas is a great place to start; it comprises five boulevards, with Plaça de Catalunya at one end and the waterfront on the other. This famous promenade is populated by cafes, restaurants, shops and street performers, and is filled with locals and tourists all hours of the day and night.

In fact, Barcelona is ideal for night owls. The city never seems to sleep, and many of the tapas restaurants, lounges and music venues don’t get going until fairly late in the evening. It’s not uncommon to schedule dinner for 10pm or later, stay out all night, and find yourself at breakfast without having made it back to your hotel. You won’t want to sleep through the day though – not when there are so many cultural sights to take in. There are famous tourist attractions like Gaudí’s Sagrada Familia and the Picasso Museum, both of which are good additions to any Barcelona itinerary. Venture off the beaten track, though, and you’ll be rewarded with leafy parks, quirky boutiques and local markets.</font></p>

<p><font face="times new roman" size="+2">Flights to Dubai</font></p>
<p><font face="times new roman" size="-1" >Try and get a seat by the window for your flights to Dubai – as the plane descends, you'll want to see the sheer scale of its dramatic sprawl along the coastline, which is just as impressive as its skyline. In little more than 40 years, this city has transformed itself from a tiny settlement to a glittering metropolis and world-class destination.

While Dubai's startling feats of engineering such as the Burj Khalifa, the Palm islands, Burj Al Arab and The Dubai Mall are jewels in its crown, the city’s multi-faceted appeal extends to more than just its architecture. Some people are attracted to the buzz of the place – the frenetic pace and energy of a global business city and tourism hub. However, you might prefer the tranquillity of its desert retreats, golf courses, calm seas and beaches.</font></p>
<p><font face="times new roman" size="-1" >Beyond clusters of gleaming five-star hotels, with their luxury suites and infinity pools, there's a historic side to the city too. Visit Al Fahidi Historical District (formerly known as Bastakiya) to see traditional Arabic architecture, then tour the Heritage and Diving Villages of Shindagha.

Visiting Dubai is largely about consumption and one of the most popular activities here is shopping. As well as record-breaking malls packed with designer names, there are traditional souks and vibrant markets. And while Michelin-starred celebrity chefs have embraced Dubai’s high-end culinary credentials, there are still scores of independent restaurants with authentic flavours to explore.

It all adds up to a city of contrasts, and there's nowhere better to witness Dubai's diversity than the Dubai Creek. Here, traditional abras cross the waters, and dhows unload their cargo beneath shimmering skyscrapers.</font></p>

<p><font face="times new roman" size="+2">Flights to Rome</font></p>
<p><font face="times new roman" size="-1" >There’s a reason why Rome is called The Eternal City. The Italian capital is among the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe, having been established around 3,000 years ago. The centre of the city is a Unesco World Heritage Site, and simply walking through the streets or wandering around the piazzas makes you feel closer to the past.

Rome remains a hugely sought after destination, as thousands of visitors descend on the capital each year to see its iconic sights, from the Pantheon to the Colosseum. For some, Rome’s significance lies in its status as home to Vatican City, an independent country that resides within its boundaries. It’s also where you’ll find the Sistine Chapel and its famous ceiling painted by Michelangelo, as well as St Peter’s Basilica, the world’s largest church. In the Vatican Museum, you’ll be bowled over by the art collection of masterpieces from the Italian Renaissance.</font></p>

<p><font face="times new roman" size="-1" >Of course, the city is not without its modern charms, and travellers catch flights to Rome from all over the world in search of the dolce vita, or sweet life. From Audrey Hepburn on her Vespa in Roman Holiday to Julia Roberts eating gelato near a fountain in Eat Pray Love, the city has always been synonymous with the pursuit of pleasure and fun.

Whatever you do in Rome, do it on foot. While the public transport system is easy enough to navigate, it’s during slow, unhurried walks around the city that you’ll discover the true hidden gems – tucked away cafes, charming boutiques and quaint bookshops, to name a few.</font></p>

</center>
<p><font face="times new roman" size="+2">Flights to London</font></p>
<p><font face="times new roman" size="-1" >Flights to London take you to a city of unforgettable landmarks. Buckingham Palace, Wembley Stadium, Big Ben, Regent’s Park, Camden Town, Notting Hill, the London Underground – the list of things to do and see in London is endless. (This includes giant Ferris wheel the London Eye, the perfect vantage point for taking it all in.Thankfully, it’s a city built for walking – and those who don’t want to walk can hire a ‘Boris Bike’ from one of the 700 bicycle docking stations around the city. Plus, flights to London would be wasted if you don’t travel on the famous London Underground or hop on one of the iconic double-decker buses while you’re there.You can find a gem – historical or modern – at every corner. Whether you’re exploring the hipster boutiques of Shoreditch or the high-end restaurants and cafes of Kensington, there’s charm and character in every alleyway.</font></p>
<p><font face="times new roman" size="-1" >The architecture is every bit as varied as the neighbourhoods, from the classical beauty of St Paul’s Cathedral to the modern majesty of The Shard. London is also blessed with acres of green space, with Hyde Park and Regent’s Park (the latter of which is home to the world-famous London Zoo) offering a welcome breather from the city.The mighty River Thames cuts through it all, running alongside the Houses of Parliament and Westminster, and passing the Tate Modern and Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre. It also winds under Tower Bridge towards Canary Wharf and Greenwich Pier.Along the Thames’ way and past its riverbanks there are hundreds of theatres, galleries, boutiques, restaurants and markets – which all promise something new to discover.Flights to London land you in either Heathrow, Gatwick or Stansted airport – all under an hour and a half’s drive to the centre of this vibrant city.</font></p>
